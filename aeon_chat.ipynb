      "**Answer**: The 'aeon.api.load' function is not explicitly defined in the provided context. However, based on its usage in the '_load_legacy_subjectdata' function, it appears to be a function used for loading data from a specific location (specified by 'data_dir') using a specific reader (specified by 'reader'), within a certain time frame (specified by 'start' and 'end'). It seems to be part of Aeon's API for handling and loading data. \n",
      "\n",
      "-> **Question**: What do the Experiment tables in the database contain? \n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer**: The Experiment table in the database contains the following information:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. `experiment_name`: A string that represents the name of the experiment. For example, 'exp0-r0'.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. `experiment_start_time`: The date and time when the experiment started.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. `experiment_description`: A text description of the experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. `lab.Arena`: A reference to the Arena table in the lab schema, which contains details about the physical space where the experiment takes place.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. `lab.Location`: A reference to the Location table in the lab schema, which contains details about the lab or room where the experiment takes place.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. `ExperimentType`: A reference to the ExperimentType table, which contains details about the type of experiment conducted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Experiment table also has two part tables: `Subject` and `Directory`.\n",
      "\n",
      "The `Subject` table contains references to the main Experiment table and the Subject table in the subject schema, indicating the subjects participating in the experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The `Directory` table contains references to the main Experiment table and the DirectoryType table. It also contains a reference to the PipelineRepository table and a directory_path field. It's used for navigating the data directories associated with an experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Experiment table also has a couple of class methods: `get_data_directory()` and `get_data_directories()`, which are used to fetch the data directory/directories associated with a given experiment. \n",
      "\n",
      "-> **Question**: How could I create a new Device made out of streams from patches and cameras? \n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer**: The process of creating a new Device using streams from patches and cameras starts by defining the streams that the Device will use. These streams are defined using the aeon.io.reader module, which contains various functions to handle different types of data streams. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to define a video stream, you'd use the function `video(pattern)`, where `pattern` is the filename pattern to look for. Other available functions include `position(pattern)`, `encoder(pattern)`, `environment(pattern)`, etc. Each function corresponds to a different type of data stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the streams are defined, they can be assigned to a Device. This is done by creating an instance of the Device class and passing the streams as arguments. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the code snippet below creates a new Device called \"CameraTop\" that uses a video stream and a position stream:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "Device(\"CameraTop\", stream.video, stream.position)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, `stream.video` and `stream.position` are streams that were defined using the aeon.io.reader functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Devices can be added to an experiment setup, which is represented by a DotMap object. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "exp02 = DotMap([\n",
      "    Device(\"CameraTop\", stream.video, stream.position)\n",
      "    # ... other devices ...\n",
      "])\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, `exp02` is a DotMap object that represents an experiment setup. It contains a list of Device objects that define the devices used in the experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the Device and its streams have been defined and added to the experiment setup, you can use the `generate_device_table(device_type)` function to generate the database table for the device. This function creates a table with a schema that matches the data streams used by the device. The table can then be used to store and retrieve data for the device. \n",
